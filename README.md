# Tambola Claim Validator - Requirements & Approach

## Problem Statement
Build a claim validator for the game of Tambola (Housie). The system should determine if a player's claim for a specific game is valid based on the numbers announced so far and the ticket provided.

---

## Functional Requirements
1. **Input:**
   - Numbers announced so far (array of numbers)
   - A valid ticket (3x9 grid, numbers or blanks)   
   - A claim for a specific game (game type)

2. **Output:**
   - Accepted/Rejected (boolean or message)

3. **Game Types (Winning Patterns):**
   - **Top line:** All numbers in the top row are crossed
   - **Middle line:** All numbers in the middle row are crossed
   - **Bottom line:** All numbers in the bottom row are crossed
   - **Full house:** All 15 numbers on the ticket are crossed
   - **Early five:** First ticket to have 5 numbers crossed

4. **Rules:**
   - System only returns whether a claim is accepted or rejected
   - A claim is only valid if made immediately after the number that completes the winning sequence is announced

## Non-Functional/Design Requirements
- Code should be clean, readable, and maintainable
- Apply SOLID, YAGNI, and KISS principles
- Use unit tests to guarantee correctness
- No GUI or command-line I/O; use code/tests for input/output
- No frameworks or databases; keep it simple and platform-agnostic

---

## Technology Choices
- **Language:** JavaScript (Node.js)
- **Testing Framework:** Jest

---

## Approach
1. Start with a simple function to check if a row is complete.
2. Expand to handle all game types using if/else or a switch statement.
3. Encapsulate logic in classes if the problem grows in complexity. ( I didnâ€™t use classes because the problem is simple and functional code is clearer for this scope. If the requirements grow, refactoring to classes would make sense.)
4. Write tests as I go to make sure each part works.
5. Refactor to remove duplication and improve clarity.
